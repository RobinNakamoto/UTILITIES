# Install Spice guest agent

1. **Open a Terminal:** Launch a terminal window in your Kali Linux virtual machine.

2. **Update Package Lists:** It's always a good practice to ensure your package lists are up to date. Run the following command to update them:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. **Install Spice Guest Tools:** Use the following command to install the Spice guest tools:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install spice-vdagent
   ```

   This command will download and install the Spice guest agent package.

4. **Start the Spice Agent:** After the installation is complete, you can start the Spice agent. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start spice-vdagent
   ```

5. **Enable Auto-Start:** To ensure that the Spice agent starts automatically with your Kali Linux VM, enable it to start at boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable spice-vdagent
   ```

6. **Restart the VM:** To apply the changes, it's a good idea to restart your Kali Linux virtual machine:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

Once your VM has restarted, the Spice guest agent should be active, and you should be able to use the shared clipboard feature with UTM on your Mac
