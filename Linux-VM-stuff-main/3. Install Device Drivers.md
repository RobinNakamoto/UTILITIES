# Install Device Drivers  _<sub>*`as required by VirtFS`</sub>_

1. Create the mount point directory named "share"[^1]
   [^1]: Where mount point is ```/media/share```
```bash
sudo mkdir /media/share
```
2. Mount the shared folder[^2]
   [^2]: N.B The shared directory is exposed under the VirtFS tag ```share```:
```bash
sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio share /media/share -oversion=9p2000.L
```

3. To automatically mount the shared folder at startup, open `/etc/fstab` with a text editor, using sudo for administrative privileges:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

4. Add the following line at the end of the file:
```bash
share /media/share 9p trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,rw 0 0
```

5. Save the file and exit the editor.
